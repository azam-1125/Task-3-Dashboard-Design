# 📊Data Analyst Internship: Task 3 - Dashboard Design

## 📝Project Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for the third task of the Elevate Data Analyst Internship. The objective was to design and create an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders using a sales and financial dataset. The project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into a compelling visual story that provides actionable business insights.

## 📦Deliverables

* Interactive Dashboard: A visual report created in Power BI, showcasing key business insights.

* Analysis Summary: A written summary of the key findings and strategic recommendations.

## 📈Key Findings from the Analysis

Based on my analysis of the Superstore sales data, here are the key insights that inform the dashboard:

### Overall Business Performance

* Total Sales: The company achieved a total of $2.3 million in sales.

* Total Profit: The total profit generated was $286,397.

* Average Order Value: The average value of each order was $230.13.

### Sales & Profitability Insights

* Sales by Category: The Technology category leads in total sales, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies.

* Sales Trend: I used a date hierarchy to analyze sales trends over time, which shows consistent growth but also seasonal fluctuations.

* Most Profitable Segments: The most profitable product and region combinations were identified as:

  1. West | Copiers

  2. West | Phones

  3. East | Phones

  4. Central | Machines

  5. South | Copiers

* Profit Ratio: I calculated the profit ratio for each category and sub-category. The analysis showed that Technology has the highest average profit ratio, while the Furniture category has the lowest.

### Customer Behavior

* Top Customers: The analysis identified the top 10 highest-spending customers. Tamara Chand emerged as the top customer, a key insight for future customer retention efforts.

## 🎨Dashboard Design Approach

My dashboard was designed with a focus on user-friendliness and clarity to ensure stakeholders can quickly find the information they need. Key design choices include:

* Visual Selection: I used a Line Chart for time-series analysis, Bar Charts to compare sales by category and region, and Card visuals for my KPIs.

* Interactivity: The dashboard includes slicers for Region, Category, and Order Date to allow for dynamic filtering and exploration.

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the dashboard and analysis, I have the following recommendations:

*  **Evaluate Shipping Mode Profitability** 📦 :
  
The current analysis focuses heavily on product and region, but shipping logistics are a major cost driver.

**Recommendation**: I recommend analyzing the Profit Ratio across different Ship Modes (Standard Class, Second Class, etc.). Determine if the faster, more expensive modes are significantly eroding margins, even on high-value sales.

*  **Deep Dive into Unprofitable Sub-Categories** 📉 :

Your current analysis identifies the Furniture category as having a low profit ratio. This next step focuses the problem on specific products within that category.

**Recommendation**: I recommend creating a dedicated visual (e.g., a simple table or bar chart) showing the top 5 Sub-Categories by total Negative Profit (the largest losses). This often highlights specific items like Tables or Bookcases that are consistently losing money due to high shipping costs, damages, or low margin.

* **Implement a Customer Segmentation Strategy** 👑:

The analysis identifies your top-spending customers, but not your most loyal or frequent ones.

**Recommendation**: I recommend performing a simple RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)-style segmentation. Since you have transaction-level data, you can calculate each customer's purchase frequency and analyze it against their profitability.
